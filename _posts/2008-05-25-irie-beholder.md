This was my first decent Second Life creation:

The monster is an "attachment" for an avatar that poses the avatar hanging out of it's mouth.

I finished the beholder just as [Burning Life](http://www.vburn.org/) 2006 was starting, so I toured the event wearing it:

Since then, I've sold a bunch of them. It has become a [popular Halloween costume](http://www.second-man.com/halloween-2007-roundup.html). You can buy your own copy of the beholder [in world](http://slurl.com/secondlife/Unreal%20Woods/77/74/67) or at [SLExchange](http://slexchange.com/modules.php?name=Marketplace&file=item&ItemID=122566).
