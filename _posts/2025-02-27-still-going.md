Decided to revive this site as a (mostly) game dev blog. I've been spending my hobby time working with the Godot game engine. As with most solo game devs, I've started quite a few projects but finished none. However, I've gone one that is pretty far along. Will be sharing some of that in some future posts.

For now, check out [IParT](/IParT). This is a little something I put together a few months back, when NFTs (collectable crypto tokens) were all the rage. I wanted to see how [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) all that "[web3](https://web3.foundation/)" stuff worked. The problem I ran into with the collectable tech was that it didn't support interactive HTML content well (only one marketplace, OpenSea, did, and it's support was limited and buggy). That took most of the fun out of it for me, who wants just a boring old static picture?

Anyway, each individual instance is a particle simulation with various variations in style and behavior. You can interact with the particles using your mouse. They are 100% deterministic. Use the [IParT](/IParT) link to see all the variations.
