I've been exploring and creating in [Second Life](http://secondlife.com) since early 2006. I've decided to post some of my discoveries and observations here.  
  
In real life I'm a software engineer. I've been building distributed systems since before there was a [World Wide Web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web), and pretty much as long as there has been an [Internet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) (but [ARPANET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET) predates me by a bit).  
  
Virtual Words interest me from a technical perspective. However, it is the emergent social and artistic aspects of Second Life that make it a very special thing.  
  
The moment I first logged on and started shaping Eye Ree, my avatar, Second Life became a tool for my personal artistic expression. It is a medium as pliable as software, while aspiring to be as tangible as the physical.
