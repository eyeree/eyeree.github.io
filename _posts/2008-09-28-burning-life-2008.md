For almost an year I have been thinking about various builds for [Burning Life 2008](http://burninglife.secondlife.com/). The theme, borrowed from [Burning Man 2008](http://www.burningman.com/art_of_burningman/bm08_theme.html), is "The American Dream". I kept focusing in on one aspect of this: given all the diversity of American culture, what is that makes us all Americans?

I had lots of ideas, all of which were too vague to be built, or too complex for Second Life to support, or just silly. When I [claimed my plot](http://www.eyeree.com/2008/09/changes.html) for this year's festival, I still didn't know what I was going to build.

So, I went looking through my inventory for anything to make my bare rectangle of playa unique and I came across a "thought balloon" attachment I had made a few months ago.

After a few days of tinkering I ended up with this:

That's some 60 randomly colored heads each with a thought balloon. The pictures shown in a thought balloon is picked randomly every few seconds from a set of some 20 or so pictures. I selected those pictures because they represent things I tend to think about and, I believe, are things that most of us think about.

If a visitor touches a head, it changes color. If a visitor touches a thought balloon, the picture shown in that thought balloon is briefly flashed on all the nearby thought balloons.

I also finished up the attachment and have been giving copies away to visitors. It is also listed on [SL Exchange](http://slexchange.com/modules.php?name=Marketplace&file=item&ItemID=922033). The attachment comes with over 200 pictures and can easily be customized to display any picture. Since I made the entire thing full permission and put it under a [Creative Commons license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/), anyone can customize it in any way they want.
