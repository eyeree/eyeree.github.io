Just a quick update.... The skin is working out nicely I think.

A special thanks to the "Nurturess" who printed and cut out some of the images for me.

Once this statue is done, I'm going to start on two more. I'm thinking the theme's for these will be: "religion" and maybe "sex". Ideas are welcome....
