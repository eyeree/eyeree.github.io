Well, [Anshe Chung Studios](http://www.anshechung.com/) decided to recycle the Unreal Woods sim I was on. They gave me other land and some bonus tier. But I got very little notice and wasn't too happy with the land that was available. 

In the end I took three different plots of commercial land because I thought I could turn them over pretty quick. So far two have sold. [The last is here](http://slurl.com/secondlife/Plush%20Zeta/210/198/22). I doubt that they would recycle a commercial sim. Maybe.

For now, I guess I'm living on [my Burning Life plot](http://slurl.com/secondlife/Burning%20Life%20\(Code\)/63/53/25). GavinLeigh Wake happened to catch a picture of me as I was claiming this plot. See his great blog post for [details on how to claim your own plot for Burning Life](http://burninglife.com/2008/09/08/how-to-grab-land.aspx?ref=rss).

I'm not sure where I'm going after that. An [OpenSim grid](http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Grid_List) has some appeal, but would Eye Ree be Eye Ree anywhere else?
