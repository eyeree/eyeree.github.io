For a while I had [land in Fillip](http://slurl.com/secondlife/Fillip/140/126/29) at the northern most point on the original mainland continent. On it I built a very large scale sculpture as a tribute to emergent complexity. It also had a vendor for my Irie Beholder and a gallery for my Vivid Purple series of digital artworks.
