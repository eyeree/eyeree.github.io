The money godling is almost done and will be making the trip to Burning Man this year... but got distracted by a different project when I saw the Craig's list add for this bike:

What I'm doing is turning it into a dragon:

With wings:

I've basically made a mount for 4 1/4" steel rods that will form the "fingers" of the dragon's wings and I've got some white mesh with shiny silver stuff on it to make the "skin" between the fingers.

It sparkly silver should gitter in the sunlight with wind blowing it. For night, I'm planning to use some [color changing leds](http://www.amazon.com/LEDwholesalers-Waterproof-2038RGB-3315-3215/dp/B0054U46Y2/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&colid=3Q2Z4IFUVU4Z&coliid=I294T7P50074R2) to light it.
