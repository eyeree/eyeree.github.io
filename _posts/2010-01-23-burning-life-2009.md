I did an installation for Burning Life again this year, 2009. The theme, borrowed from Burning Man, was [Evolution](http://www.burningman.com/art_of_burningman/bm09_theme.html).

What I built was a "Tree of Life" that you could ride from base to tip along a random path. If you intersect an "Environmental Factor" (the colorful spherical things) on the journey you are ejected. If you make it to the bubble your road stays with your name over it. The tree starts off empty and over the course of the event it filled out with the glowing bubbles of the survivors.
