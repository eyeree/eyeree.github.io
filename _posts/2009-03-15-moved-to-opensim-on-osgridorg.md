_How long before Linden Lab really starts to worry about that statement?_

Anyway, I've moved to the self (ok, RL self) hosted EyeRee region on [osgrid.org](http://osgrid.org).

Stop by and get a free copy of the [Irie Beholder](http://www.eyeree.com/2008/05/irie-beholder.html). Look around. I've re-created [Irie Life](http://www.eyeree.com/2008/05/irie-life.html), [Knowledge](http://www.eyeree.com/2008/05/burning-life-2007.html) and [Mind Share](http://www.eyeree.com/2008/09/burning-life-2008.html).

Whole place is still very much a work in progress.
